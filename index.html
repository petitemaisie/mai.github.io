      Pho is a Vietnamese soup dish consisting of broth, rice noodles (bánh phở), herbs, and meat (usually beef) (phở bò), sometimes chicken (phở gà).
      Pho is a popular food in Vietnam where it is served in households, street stalls and restaurants countrywide. Pho is considered Vietnam's national dish.
    <br>
      Pho originated in the early 20th century in northern Vietnam, and was popularized throughout the world by refugees after the Vietnam War. 
      Because pho's origins are poorly documented, there is disagreement over the cultural influences that led to its development in Vietnam, as well as the etymology of the name. 
      The Hanoi (northern) and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs.
     <br> 
      Pho is very famous in Vietnam, Vietnameses can eat at all meals of the day.
     <br> 
      I totally fond of this dish and I really want to introduce Pho to all my international friends. I hope they enjoy it like me :D!
